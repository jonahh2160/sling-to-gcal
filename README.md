Python script to import Sling .xls shift schedules into Google Calendar

## Description

Sling is an employee scheduling app. It offers no easy way to export those shifts into another calendar app. I have had to put shifts into Google Calendar manually for a while now, and it has become a cumbersome process.

I decided, at my peer's suggestion, that I would sit down and write a script to automate this process. For anyone else using Sling, I hope this will be helpful. Thanks for viewing the page.
